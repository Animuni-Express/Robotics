🤖 Robotics

A collection of my robotics projects, experiments, and class work.
This repository focuses on learning how robots sense their environment, move correctly, and make decisions using simple logic.

📘 Overview

This repo contains:

Arduino-based robot code

Sensor experiments (ultrasonic, IR, etc.)

Motor driver and servo tests

Robotics class assignments

Personal experiments and prototype ideas

Everything here helps me understand how real robots behave through hands-on practice.

🧱 Project Categories
1. Sensors

Experiments with:

Ultrasonic distance measurement

IR obstacle detection

Basic sensor testing and calibration

2. Motors & Movement

Code related to:

L298N motor driver

DC motor behavior

Servo control

Speed, turning, and alignment tests

3. Robots

Small robot builds such as:

Obstacle avoidance robots

Line/edge detection attempts

Maze-solving logic prototypes

Wall-following experiments

4. Drafts & Experiments

Unfinished sketches, ideas, or quick tests that may turn into full projects later.

🔧 Tools I Use

Arduino IDE

Wokwi simulator

Tinkercad Circuits

Breadboards, motors, sensors, and basic robotics components

🎯 Learning Goals

I use this repo to improve:

Sensor accuracy and filtering

Smooth motor control

Navigation and turning logic

Clean and organized Arduino code

Understanding how robots react in real situations
